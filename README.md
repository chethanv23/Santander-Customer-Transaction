# Santander-Customer-Transaction
Santander Customer Transaction Prediction.

# Problem statement:
At Santander, mission is to help people and businesses prosper. We are always looking for ways to help our customers understand their financial health and identify which products and services might help them achieve their monetary goals.
In this project, I have addressed Santander customer transaction classification problem, The aim of the project is to identify which customers will make a specific transaction in the future, irrespective of the amount of money transacted

Steps Followed:

1)Exploratory Data Analysis • Missing Value Analysis • Outlier Analysis

2)Feature selection

4)Model Development  Language R • Test Train Split • Logistic Regression • Model Evaluation

• Performed Desision tree Algorithm on the data set and evaluated the model with the help of confusion matrix.

Model accuracy stands at 90.54% with SENSITIVITY  14.14 , becouse of class imbalance we are getting low sensitivity values.

business ojective demands higher Sensitivity,So dicreased the thresh hold level to 0.12 hence model sensitivity increased to 67% at the cost of overall reduction in the accuracy of the model i.e to 77%

5)Model development Language Python: • Test Train Split • Light Gradient Boosting Method • Model Evaluation
  
  Model performed with the overall accuracy of 90.30% , sensitivity 89.59% at the thresh hold level 0.2
